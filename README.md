# Malcolm Decuire's Sales Engineer Demo Repo 

## What is this repo 
- A template to blend finance & software development 
- This is a repo to showcase my coding, product development, and project management experience on a topic I love & enjoy 

## Who is this for? 
- Hiring Managers
- Undergrads studying finance or tech
- Development Hobbyists

## Why did I choose this tech stack 
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Material UI, HeadlessUI
- Backend: Node.js, Typescript,   
- I was inspired by tailwindUI, alpack, and a few others who had a mobile first design philosophy about web development 
- I'm a big proponet of using existing templates and mapping them to strong business/commercial stories so that I can stay motivated 
- There's an increasing demand for fullstack developers & folks who can at least prototype applications
